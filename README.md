# 🖥️ Rahil’s Terminal Portfolio

An **interactive terminal-style developer portfolio** built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
It simulates a real Linux shell where users can run commands to explore my projects, skills, and fun extras — all from the comfort of a terminal UI.
